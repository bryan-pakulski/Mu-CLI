# Teacher Mode

A structured course engine that turns the agent into a coach for a new
skill (e.g. "teach me Perl", "how do I use Kubernetes"). Switch in via
`/mode teacher`. Course management is independent of the mode: `/teach
new <subject>` works from any mode and creates a course; `/mode teacher`
is what lets the agent actually drive lessons against it.

The hard contract: a lesson is COMPLETE only when its assignment passes
verification. For code/quiz kinds the engine runs a verify command and
checks markers literally; for socratic-dialog kinds the engine enforces
`min_turns` and `required_concepts` coverage. `decide_next(advance)` is
refused unless the most recent grade passed — no "looks right to me"
inflation.

For non-teaching workflows see [feature](feature_plan_engine.md) for
phased implementation work and [security](security_mode.md) for audits.

## Engine tools

The teacher engine is the only source of truth for course progress.

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `create_course` | Open a new course. Status begins as `diagnosing`. |
| `record_diagnostic` | Save strengths / gaps / goals after a short Q&A with the learner. Required before propose_curriculum. |
| `propose_curriculum` | Replace the modules + lessons with a proposed curriculum. Flips status to `curriculum_proposed`. |
| `approve_curriculum` | Learner-side approval. Unlocks the lesson loop; refuses unless status is `curriculum_proposed`. |
| `start_lesson` | Set the current lesson and flip its status to `presenting`. |
| `present_concept` | Record the agent's ≤3-sentence intro for the lesson. |
| `assign_exercise` | Create an assignment. Engine writes `artifact_files` to `work/` and persists the verification spec. |
| `submit_assignment` | Record the learner's submission payload (inline answer or notes referencing edited artifact files). |
| `grade_assignment` | Run the verifier. For exec_markers kinds runs `verify_cmd`; for MC/fill-blank with live UI launches the quiz Application; for rubric kinds requires `llm_rubric_score` after the keyword gate passes. |
| `decide_next` | Advance or remediate a graded lesson. Refuses `advance` unless the lesson's last grade passed. |
| `record_dialog_turn` | For `socratic-dialog` assignments — append one Q or A turn. |
| `close_dialog` | Finalize a socratic-dialog assignment with `mastery_pct`, `summary`, `gaps`. Refuses unless `min_turns` and `required_concepts` thresholds are met. |
| `get_course_state` | Snapshot: status, current module/lesson, metrics, latest grade. |
| `complete_module` | Mark a module complete. Refuses unless all its lessons are completed AND aggregate score ≥ `mastery_threshold`. |
| `finalize_course` | Write the report card, save a `user_skill:<subject>` memory, mark the course completed. |
| `raise_teacher_blocker` | Signal that the agent needs learner clarification before proceeding. |

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Diagnose (3–5 short questions)

1. `create_course` with the subject.
2. Ask the learner ~3 calibration questions (prior experience, related
   languages, target use-case). Keep them concrete and quick.
3. `record_diagnostic` with what you learned.

### Phase 2 — Curriculum proposal

1. `propose_curriculum` with 3–8 modules, each with 2–6 lessons.
2. Show the proposal to the learner. Wait for `approve_curriculum`.

### Phase 3 — Per-lesson loop

Repeat until the course is complete.

1. `start_lesson(next_lesson_id)`.
2. `present_concept` — ≤ 3 sentences. Concrete, with one runnable
   example if applicable.
3. `assign_exercise` — pick the SMALLEST exercise that proves the
   concept. Pick the kind to match the topic:
   - **code**: `fix-broken-code` (you write a broken file via
     `artifact_files`; learner edits) or `implement-from-scratch`.
   - **factual recall**: `multiple-choice` or `fill-blank` with
     `quiz_questions` — engine launches the live quiz UI automatically.
   - **theory / design / "why does X work this way"**:
     `socratic-dialog` — set `verification.min_turns` and
     `verification.required_concepts`, drive the dialog through
     `record_dialog_turn` (one call per agent question, one per learner
     answer). Close with `close_dialog`.
   - **read a trace**: `predict-output` or `explain-trace`.
4. Learner does the work. Call `submit_assignment` if they answered
   inline; for code edits the engine reads the work files at grade time.
5. `grade_assignment` (or `close_dialog` for socratic kinds).
6. Give specific, honest feedback. If they got 40%, say so.
7. `decide_next(advance | remediate)`. If `remediate`, do a *different*
   small exercise on the same concept — don't repeat the failed one.

### Phase 4 — Module review

After every lesson in a module passes, `complete_module`. The engine
refuses if aggregate score < the module's `mastery_threshold`. If
refused, schedule a remediation lesson for the weakest topic and loop.

### Phase 5 — Course completion

`finalize_course` writes the report card and saves
`user_skill:<subject>` to task memory so future courses can recall what
the learner already knows.

## Assignment kinds

| Kind | Verification | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fix-broken-code` | exec + markers | Engine writes a `.pl`/`.py` file with a bug; learner edits. `verify_cmd` runs it; `expected_markers` must literally appear. |
| `implement-from-scratch` | exec + markers | Engine writes a spec + test harness. Learner writes the solution file. |
| `predict-output` | exact / regex match | Engine shows code; learner predicts the output. Compared literally or by regex. |
| `multiple-choice` | exact match | Engine presents N options. Live quiz UI by default. |
| `fill-blank` | regex match | Engine presents text with `___`. Live quiz UI by default. |
| `command-output` | exec + markers | Engine asks the learner to run a shell command and paste output; markers checked. |
| `short-answer` | rubric_judge + keyword gate | Prose answer. Required terms MUST appear before LLM rubric scoring is admitted. |
| `explain-trace` | rubric_judge + keyword gate | Learner explains what code does. Same two-gate flow as short-answer. |
| `socratic-dialog` | dialog close | Back-and-forth Q&A for concepts. Engine enforces `min_turns` and `required_concepts` coverage. |

## Live quiz UI

For `multiple-choice` and `fill-blank` assignments the engine launches a
full-screen prompt-toolkit Application via `session.ui.run_quiz`. Arrow
keys navigate; Enter submits the current question and reveals
correctness with the question's `explanation`; `→` advances; `←`
reviews (read-only after submit); `q` / `Esc` exits early. When
prompt-toolkit can't drive the TTY (CI, redirected stdin) the engine
falls back to chat-flow Q&A — the picker is a polish layer, not a
requirement.

## Operating principles

- **Teach by doing.** Concept briefs are ≤ 3 sentences. Every concept
  is followed by an assignment.
- **Small steps.** Lessons are 5–15 minutes of learner time, not 90.
- **Ask, don't tell.** Whenever you could explain, ask the learner to
  predict. Then reveal.
- **Verifiable assignments only.** If you can't write a `verify_cmd`,
  expected_answer, or rubric_keywords that pass/fail objectively, fall
  back to `socratic-dialog` with concrete `required_concepts` so the
  engine still enforces coverage.
- **Honest grading.** A failed assignment is data, not a problem.
  Remediate, don't paper over.
- **Memory discipline.** `save_memory` durable facts about the learner
  (preferred analogies, sticking points, language background) — future
  lessons benefit.

## Output artifacts

Everything lives under `<workspace>/courses/<course_id>/` — a top-level
visible folder in whatever workspace the user attached via `/workspace
folder ...`. No hashed paths, no hidden directories: the learner can
`cd` straight in and operate on assignment work files normally. If no
workspace is attached, the engine falls back to the current working
directory.

```
course.json              # full Course state
curriculum.md            # human-readable syllabus (regenerated)
transcript.md            # running log of interactions (optional)
report_card.md           # written by finalize_course
modules/<id>.md          # per-module overview
lessons/<id>.md          # per-lesson notes
assignments/
  <assignment_id>/
    prompt.md            # full instructions
    work/                # ENGINE-CREATED artifacts (broken code, specs, ...)
    submission/          # USER-PROVIDED artifacts
    grade.json           # Grade record
    dialog.md            # for socratic-dialog assignments: full transcript
```

The conversation is incidental; the directory is the course record.

## Slash commands

`/teach` works from any mode (handy for `/teach status` peeks). See
[commands.md](commands.md) for the full reference.

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `/teach new <subject>` | Create a new course in this workspace. Does NOT auto-switch mode — run `/mode teacher` next. |
| `/teach list` | List courses in this workspace. |
| `/teach load <id>` | Activate an existing course. |
| `/teach exit` / `unload` | Clear active course (course stays on disk). |
| `/teach status` | Current module/lesson, progress %, average score. |
| `/teach next` | Show next pending lesson. |
| `/teach grades` | Markdown table of every graded assignment. |
| `/teach curriculum` | Render the syllabus. |
| `/teach delete <id>` | Delete a course (irreversible). |

## Plan-mode interaction

Toggling `/plan on` while in teacher mode blocks every write-side
teacher tool (`create_course`, `assign_exercise`, `grade_assignment`,
`decide_next`, `complete_module`, `finalize_course`, etc.) with the
standard plan-mode envelope. `get_course_state` and `raise_teacher_blocker`
remain available so the agent can still surface status during planning.
